# Alzheimer-s_ML_Model
deep learning model based on EfficientNetB0 to classify brain MRI images into four Alzheimer’s stages: Non Demented, Very Mild, Mild, and Moderate Demented.  The model applies image preprocessing, transfer learning,and regularization techniques such as Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Early Stopping to achieve high accuracy and reduce overfitting.
